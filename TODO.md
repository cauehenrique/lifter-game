    - [X] Make a better code on `lift_machine`, and what I mean by saying that? Make a fucking state machine you dumbass.
    - [X] Try not to use `_process`.
- [X] Put more impact when a `gordo` walks.
    - [X] `smoke_particles` when they step.
    - [X] A little bit of screen-shake to make the player feel the impact on ground.
