# What do I need to do?

## Essentials
- [ ] Work on **the bug found by a lot of players**, you know what I'm talking about.
    - [X] Make a better code on `lift_machine`, and what I mean by saying that? Make a fucking state machine you dumbass.
    - [ ] Try not to use `_process`.
- [ ] Put more impact when a `gordo` walks.
    - [ ] `smoke_particles` when they step.
    - [ ] A little bit of screen-shake to make the player feel the impact on ground.
- [ ] More game modes, by now, "Easy", "Medium", "Hard"
- [ ] Better "Game Over", also, it's important to show the player the `best_score` and `last_score` at this screen.

## Sound
- [ ] Find more ways of giving the player feedback with sound.
- [ ] Start thinking about game's music.
